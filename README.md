# EDA-on-Fitness-Data
Exploratory Data Analysis on Gym Members Exercise Dataset

# Overview

This project aims to explore the relationship between key physical and demographic factors—such as age, gender, and body composition (BMI)—and fitness metrics like calories burned, workout frequency, and hydration needs. Using a dataset containing metrics such as heart rate, BMI, water intake, and calorie burns, the analysis seeks to identify patterns that can help design effective fitness recommendations for different population groups.

# Objectives

 --Understand how age, gender, and BMI impact fitness and exercise trends.
 --Analyze calorie burn rates and hydration needs based on different demographics.
 --Identify missing values and clean the dataset for better insights.
 --Use visualizations to present findings effectively.

# Dataset: 
The dataset used in this project is gymdata.csv, which contains the following features - Age, Gender, BMI, Calories Burned, Workout Frequency, 
Water Intake, Heart Rate,Technologies Used, Python,Pandas,NumPy,Matplotlib,Seaborn.

# Setup Instructions

1.Clone this repository:
2.git clone <repository-url>
3.Install required dependencies:
4.pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn
5.Run the Jupyter Notebook to explore the analysis:jupyter notebook f_analysis.ipynb

# Key Steps in Analysis

1.Load the dataset and perform an initial inspection.
2.Clean the data and handle missing values.
3.Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) using visualizations.
4.Identify patterns and trends in fitness metrics.

# Results & Insights

-BMI and calorie burn show a significant correlation, with higher BMI individuals requiring different workout strategies.
-Hydration needs vary significantly across age groups.
-Workout frequency differs based on gender and fitness goals.
